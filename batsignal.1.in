.B \-m SECONDS
Minimum number of SECONDS (default 60) to wait between battery checks. Settings SECONDS to 0 disables polling and waits for the USR1 signal before checking battery level. Prefixing SECONDS with a + (ex: -m +10) will force a check at SECONDS intervals, regardless of battery level.
.TP
.B \-a APP_NAME
App name used in notifications (default: batsignal)
.TP

Display specified ICON in notifications
.SH SIGNALS
batsignal responds to the following signals:
.TP
.B SIGUSR1
Sending the process SIGUSR1 will cause an immediate battery check to be performed.
.SH NOTES
In most cases, batsignal will perform fewer battery state checks while the battery is discharging and the level of charge is not near a warning level.
This frequency is affected by the multiplier (-m) option and is never less than <multiplier> seconds.
If the "full" level (-f) is set or charge/discharge messages are enabled (-p), batsignal will instead check the battery state every <multiplier> seconds regardless of level of charge.

If the "full" level (-f) is set, the battery full notification will be triggered at the given level of charge or when the battery status changes to full, whichever occurs first.

The message COMMAND passed with -M is a C printf-style format string.
It can use two string placeholders (%s) that will be replaced by the message text and the current battery level.
Be sure to test the command - invalid format strings may cause batsignal to crash.

Ex: -M "wall 'Battery warning: %s - Level is %s'"
