batsignal - Simple battery monitor
==================================
batsignal is a battery daemon which notifies the user via libnotify about
low battery. It is meant to be used with minimal window managers.


Features
--------
Two customizable warnings via libnotify on two different configurable battery
levels.


Requirements
------------
In order to build batsignal you need the libnotify library.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (batsignal is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install batsignal (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running batsignal
-----------------
See the man page for details.


Configuration
-------------
batsignal can be customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the
source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
